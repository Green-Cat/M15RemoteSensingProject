Unsupervised and Supervised Classification
========================================================

We have gone over unsupervised and supervised classification in class.
Quick refresher:
- Unsupervised: 
- Supervised: 

What I made
========================================================

- Web interface to play with different inputs into classification
- Support for both unsupervised and supervised classification
- Customisable number of classes and sample size
- Display of accuracy for supervised classification

Demo time =)
========================================================



Results
========================================================

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](presentation-figure/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)

Clearly less accuracy the more classes we have.

But why?
